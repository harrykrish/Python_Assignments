### Feedback
Assignment 2:
->I could not see any folder structure for Q2.
->The 2nd part of question 2 is not there
</br>
- I can see your effort, and it is good that you done the work on your own. Also I can tell that you may face problems doing assignment 2. You may not always have a Chinese TA and a nice Indian TA, please use us if you have any doubts. Hari and me are always here to help.
- I listed some problems I found in your code below. 
- Question 1&2: Result should be sorted.
- Question 4: count() can not solve all problem. Find another way to achieve the right answer. 
- Question 5: The requirement for this question is top 50 and top 5, please check you output.
- Question 6: Merge the file first, then set words unique. Otherwise, you can not remove the same words which is redundant in two files. 
- Question 8: isalpha() will remove the words like ‘4ever,gr8’ as well.
- One more thing is you may not like to find and read the file manually. In assignment 2 and later project, you will face hundreds of files which you need write the right loop and condition to find the exact files you need. Again, If you have any problem. 随时来找我或者Hari。songtianjie001 是我的微信，有需要可以加我。
